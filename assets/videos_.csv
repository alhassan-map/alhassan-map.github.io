1,Poultry traders,,32.5055748,36.0241472,"Most migrant workers only eat meat or chicken once a week, on their Friday holiday. Poultry is the cheapest option and to assure the meat is fresh, most workers buy from Jordanian vendors who slaughter the chicken or pigeons right in front of them.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
2,Fish vendors,,32.5062520,36.0253275,"Fish is very important in Bangladeshi cuisine, and while imported frozen salt water fish is the preferred choice, it is very expensive. Some workers thus buy cheaper sweet water carp, sold by young Jordanian boys from Al-Ramtha in the Friday market.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
3,Clothing and beauty salon,,32.5054057,36.0217374,"What looks like a simple clothing shop from the outside is in fact a beauty parlour and hair salon, second-hand clothes shop, and a tailoring and dressmaking workshop that is run by a Palestinian-Bangladeshi couple who met in the Al-Hassan factories seven years ago.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
4,Phase II Market,,32.5048516,36.0183840,"Behind a giant block of dormitories accommodating over ten thousand female workers, a row of shops forms a dense market street. Especially on Fridays, Jordanian street vendors trade fresh food alongside Bangladeshi female vendors offering Asian vegetables. Informal taxis and busses compete for space with pedestrians and bikes in the dusty street.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
5,Secret Back Entrance,,,,"Several unofficial entry ways allow workers to climb over the industrial zone’s back wall, thus entering or leaving unobserved by the private security firms that man the official entry gates. Rocky foot paths, dark at night and ill-reputed for robberies and sexual harassment, lead down a hill and towards the Phase II market.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
6,The Warehouse Quarter,,32.506582,36.032564,"Escaping the crowds and noise is the biggest desire of many workers after endless work shifts with little oxygen, noisy machines and artificial white light. At the back end of the industrial zone, a row of warehouses offers unobstructed views of the night sky and silence, and many workers come here to speak in privacy on the phone, go for walks, or meet their friends and lovers.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
7,Money Transfer Office,,32.4997588,36.0211240,"After the monthly pay day, crowds of workers hurry to the numerous money transfer and exchange offices, mostly to send a substantial part of their salary back home. The exchange rate and commission charges determine when and from where workers send money, and informal money lenders often gather in front of the transfer offices, exploiting situations of financial distress with high interest rates.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
8,Workers’ Centre,,32.5051489,36.0295716,"This social space opened in 2014 with support from the International Labour Organisation. Besides sports and educational activities, the canteen is used for shared meals and celebrations, and workers receive legal and personal support. However, the Centre has been closed due to the 2025 US funding cuts, and workers have lost their only space for leisure and socialising in the industrial zone.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
9,The Factory Canteen,,32.4999871,36.0259886,"From the 230 JD (251GBP) monthly salaries of migrant workers, 95JD are automatically subtracted for accommodation and catering. During morning, lunch and dinner breaks, workers rush to the crowded factory canteens where different nationalities are served separately. Yet as many consider the canteen food unhealthy and tasteless, many come with plastic boxes and only take rice to then prepare their own food back in the dorms.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
10,End of Factory Shifts,,32.5029417,36.0236333,"Jordanian workers rarely work overtime hours, so start their regular work shifts at 7am and finish at 3pm. Busses wait for the majority female workers to take them back to Irbid, Ramtha or villages in the Jordan valley. Meanwhile, foreign workers never know when their factory shifts end, as production rhythms determine the surplus hours they are asked to work. During peak seasons, shifts often last until 8 or even 10pm – so far beyond the legal maximum of 60hour work weeks – and mobile vendors take over the zone’s sidewalks once tens of thousands of workers leave the factories.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
11,Rubina Hostels,,32.4935061,36.0192351,"A block of dorms for over 3500 male workers to the South of the industrial zone is surrounded by a lively commercial street with restaurants, barbers and alcohol shops. The private security guards denounce any female worker approaching the hostels, turning it into a male-only area. The gym is the only space to let off steam, exposing working bodies to another type of machines.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
12,The Dormitory,,32.4961195,36.0244020,"Most dormitories are gender segregated and workers of the same nationality share rooms and building floors. Private security firms patrol entry and exit and enforce a strict curfew. Living in dormitory rooms shared by 6-10 workers means a constant lack of privacy and oxygen, and workers often spend hours queuing to take turns in the overcrowded kitchens and bathrooms.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
13,Subcontracting Factory,,32.4983430,36.0233175,"Smaller factories, mainly owned by Palestinians from Gaza in Al-Hassan, work as subcontractors for the larger clothing producers or manufacture garments for the Israeli market. These subcontractors mainly employ Indian male workers and have all work steps concentrated in a single space. As there is less oversight by big clothing brands, conditions of work and accommodation are often especially bad for workers in subcontracting factories.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
14,Exporting Factory,,32.4948314,36.0299977,"Most factories in Al-Hassan manufacture sports and outdoor clothing for large American brands and export directly to the US under a Free Trade Agreement. The shopfloors are organised in production lines, where mainly female workers sit on sewing machines and automated target tables count their production output. Supervisors walk up and down the lines, and even a toilet break requires authorisation.",_eaf_fmJCoc,
